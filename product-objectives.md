# product objectives
create a unique social atmosphere
  As Impresso! Coffee & Comestibles is located in an out-of-the way Wellington neighborhood, it would be beneficial to create an atmosphere that pulls not only the locals but also people from surrounding neighborhoods.
sell great coffee and food
  not just by telling people that you have great coffee and food, but by creating a story as to why it is so great. This can be done through detailing where ingredients are sourced from and what goes into making that coffee your customers crave.
promote artwork of locals
  Tied in with the unique social atmosphere, by using the cafe to display local art it can help people associate the cafe in a way that others are not. This could be a point of differentiation as there are so many cafes! This could lead to opportunites for the cafe to supply coffee to gallery evenings.
make profit
  Quite simple really, attract customers to purchase your products at a price that will result in profit.
